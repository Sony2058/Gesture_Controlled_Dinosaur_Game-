# Gesture_Controlled_Dinosaur_Game-
This project enables gesture-based control of the Chrome Dinosaur game using Python, OpenCV, Mediapipe, and PyAutoGUI. It captures hand gestures through a webcam and maps them to game controls: a one-finger gesture triggers the dinosaur to jump, while a two-finger gesture makes it duck or stay still.
